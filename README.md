# Verify.ai 🧠  
**Agentic & Verifiable RAG for Research and Knowledge Work**

Verify.ai is an advanced **agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed to turn raw, untrusted data into **qualified, auditable, and explainable knowledge**.

Unlike traditional RAG pipelines, Verify.ai introduces **knowledge governance as a first-class concept**, enabling transparency, traceability, and adaptive reasoning.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔹 Dual Knowledge Architecture
- **Raw Data Store** — immutable source data
- **Qualified Knowledge Store** — LLM-validated, context-enriched knowledge

### 🔹 LLM-Based Data Qualification
Each source is automatically:
- Evaluated for reliability
- Enriched with metadata
- Scored with confidence metrics

Only verified knowledge enters the reasoning pipeline.

### 🔹 Full Audit Trail
Every output includes:
- Source provenance
- Confidence scores
- Included & excluded sources
- Qualification rationale

### 🔹 Modular Source Control
- Toggle sources on/off
- Instantly recompute reasoning
- Preserve full traceability

### 🔹 Agentic Reasoning
- Multi-step planning
- Role-aware synthesis
- Source-bound generation
